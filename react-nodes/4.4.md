# Defining Node Attributes/Props

The second argument that is passed to `React.createElement(type, props, children)` is an object containing name value properties (a.k.a, props).

Props take on several roles:

1. Props can become HTML attributes. If a prop matches a known HTML attribute then it will be added to the final HTML element in the DOM.
2. Props passed to `createElement()` become values stored in a `prop` object as an instance property of `React.createElement()` instances  (i.e., `[INSTANCE].props.[NAME OF PROP]`). Props are normally used to input values into components.
3. A few special props have side effects (e.g., [`key`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#dynamic-children), [`ref`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html), and [`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/dangerously-set-inner-html.html))

In one sense you can think of props as the configuration options for React nodes and in another sense you can think of them as HTML attributes.

In the code example below I am defining a React `<li>` element node with five props. One is a non-standard HTML attribute (i.e., `foo:'bar'`) and the others are known HTML attributes.

```js
var reactNodeLi = React.createElement('li',
    {
        foo: 'bar',
        id: 'li1',
        // Note the use of the JS className property to change the 
        // class attribute below
        className: 'blue',
        'data-test': 'test',
        'aria-role' :'listitem',
        // Note use of JS camel-cased CSS property backgroundColor below
        style: {backgroundColor:'red'}
    },
    'text'
);
```

When the above code is rendered to an HTML page the actual HTML created will look like:

```html
<li id="li1" data-test="test" class="blue" aria-role="listitem" style="background-color:red;" data-reactid=".0">text</li>
```

What you need to realize is only the following attributes get passed to the real DOM from the Virtual DOM

* [Standard HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes),
* [Custom data attributes `data-*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*), and 
* [Accessibility attributes `aria-*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)

The `foo` attribute/prop does not show up in the real DOM. This non-standard HTML attribute is available as an instance property of the created `li` React node instance. (e.g., `reactNodeLi.props.foo`).

React attributes/props not only translate to real HTML attributes props, they become configuration values that are passed to React components. This aspect of props will be covered in the React component props chapter. For now simply realize that passing a prop into a React node is different from defining a prop on a component to be used as configuration input within a component.

#### Notes

* Leaving an attribute/prop blank results in that attribute value becoming true (e.g., `id=""` becomes `id="true"` and `test` becomes `test="true"`)
* If an attribute/prop is duplicated the last one defined wins.
* If you pass props/attributes to native HTML elements that do not exist in the HTML specification React will not render them. However, if you use a custom element (i.e., not a standard HTML element) then arbitrary/custom attributes will be added to custom elements (e.g., `<x-my-component custom-attribute="foo"/>`).
* The `class` attribute has to be written `className`
* The `for` attribute has to be written `htmlFor`
* The `style` attribute takes a reference to an object of [camel-cased style properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties)
* HTML form elements (e.g., `<input></input>`, `<textarea></textarea>`, etc.) created [as React nodes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html) support a few attributes/props that are affected by user interaction. These are: `value`, `checked`, and `selected`.
* React offers the [`key`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#dynamic-children), [`ref`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html), and [`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/dangerously-set-inner-html.html) attributes/props that don't exist in DOM and take on a unique role/function.
* All attributes are camel-cased (e.g., `accept-charset` is written as `acceptCharset`) which differs from how they are written in HTML.
* The following are the HTML attributes that React supports (shown in camel-case):

```HTML
accept acceptCharset accessKey action allowFullScreen allowTransparency alt
async autoComplete autoFocus autoPlay capture cellPadding cellSpacing challenge
charSet checked classID className colSpan cols content contentEditable
contextMenu controls coords crossOrigin data dateTime default defer dir
